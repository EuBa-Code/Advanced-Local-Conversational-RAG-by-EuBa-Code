WHITEPAPER: AETHEROS - THE FIRST COGNITIVE OPERATING SYSTEM

1. THE CONCEPT OF AETHEROS
AetherOS is not a traditional operating system based on the "Desktop-File-Folder" metaphor of the 1970s. It is an "Agent-Centric" environment designed for the AI age. In AetherOS, there are no "Apps" in the traditional sense; instead, there are "Capabilities." The user interface is entirely generated in real-time by a multimodal LLM based on the user's current intent and task requirements.

2. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
- Microkernel: Based on 'L4Re', the AetherOS kernel is extremely minimal to reduce the attack surface. It isolates every process in hardware-encrypted sandboxes, ensuring that a vulnerability in a media player cannot compromise the entire system.
- Semantic File System: Data is not saved in fixed, hierarchical paths. Instead, all user data is indexed vectorially at the moment of creation. Users retrieve information by describing context: "Show me the project notes I took during the meeting with the marketing team last Tuesday."
- Hardware Synergy: AetherOS is co-designed with our upcoming 'AetherBook' laptops, featuring dedicated NPU (Neural Processing Unit) clusters that handle 90% of AI tasks locally, ensuring user privacy.

3. NATIVE AI INTEGRATION
Unlike current operating systems that treat AI as a "plugin" or a "sidecar," the AI in AetherOS resides in the kernel. This allows the system to autonomously optimize CPU/GPU allocation by predicting user activity. For instance, if the system detects the start of a video-editing workflow, it pre-allocates high-speed memory and suppresses non-essential background updates to ensure zero-lag performance.

4. AVAILABILITY AND RELEASE CYCLE
- Internal Alpha (Project 'Genesis'): Q4 2025. Currently being tested by the Aetheria internal squad.
- Public Developer Beta (Project 'Exodus'): Q2 2026. Will include a full SDK for building "Cognitive Capabilities."
- Stable Release: Late 2027, launching alongside the proprietary 'AetherBook' hardware. We aim to reach 10 million active nodes by 2030.
