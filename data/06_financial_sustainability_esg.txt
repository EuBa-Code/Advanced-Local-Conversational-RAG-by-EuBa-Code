ANNUAL FINANCIAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT (FY 2025)

1. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Aetheria Global Solutions closed the 2025 fiscal year with a total revenue of $840 million USD, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. This growth was primarily driven by the expansion of our 'Nexus-as-a-Service' (NaaS) platform and high-margin consulting for smart city projects.
- Operating Margin: 34%, driven by the automation of 70% of internal support processes through our proprietary AI agents.
- R&D Investment: 40% of total revenue is reinvested into fundamental research. Current focus areas include photonic hardware for AI inference and carbon-capture-ready computation facilities.

2. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) INITIATIVES
Our goal is to be "Carbon Negative" by 2028. We don't just buy carbon offsets; we actively reduce our footprint through infrastructure innovation.
- Green Infrastructure: 95% of our server load is currently powered by geothermal and wind energy. We have formed long-term partnerships with Icelandic energy providers for natural rack cooling using Arctic air, which reduces our cooling energy consumption by 80%.
- Circular Economy: 100% of decommissioned server hardware is either refurbished for educational charities or ethically recycled to reclaim rare-earth metals.

3. SOCIAL IMPACT AND THE AETHERIA FOUNDATION
The Aetheria Foundation represents our commitment to global equity. We have allocated $10 million USD for digital literacy and AI ethics programs in emerging economies.
- Project Lumina: Provides free satellite connectivity and access to specialized educational AI models to over 500 rural schools in Africa and South America. We believe that access to information is a fundamental human right.
- Ethics Fellowships: Funding for independent researchers to study the long-term impacts of AI on labor markets and social cohesion.

4. AI ETHICS BOARD AND GOVERNANCE
We have established an "Independent Ethics Council" (IEC) composed of external academics, lawyers, and human rights advocates. The IEC has the power to veto any product release that violates user privacy or shows significant algorithmic bias. Every model must pass the 'Veritas Test'—a rigorous statistical audit for fairness—before it is deployed to production.
